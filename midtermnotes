DEADLOCK:
    strategies dealing with deadlock
        -ignore it (ostridge method)
        -prevent: deny one of the conditions
        -avoid: "Pretend" to grant, check safety of state
        -detect + recover: find the deadlock the recover the program (look for cycles) check deadlock. recover by either terminating a process or preempt a resource.

turn = 0;

Writer
while(T){
	while(turn == 1)
	  ;
	get_input();
	write_shared_M();
	turn = 1;
   }

Reader
while(T){
	while(turn == 0)
	  ;
	read_shared_M();
	print_msg();
	turn = 0;
  }

Cannot put a sleep bc timing is not allowed, it will fail somehow.
A good solution is to use two variables to determine who's turn it is. 
	Writer/Reader both would set turn0 = 1 and turn1 = 1
